  <h1>reading (sorta?)</h1>
  <p>i used to read A LOT in elementary / middle school but have since tapered off</p>
  <p>i'm trying to read more though! here are my current reads</p>
    <div>
    <h2>read (starting 9/11/24)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>earthlings</h3>
        <p>very simple and short read, but the content is super heavy. i wasn't a huge fan of the book overall, it covered topics (child sa and child neglect) that made me feel really sad.
          the ending gets reallyyy bizarre. i feel like this book covers child development a bit but the tone in the first half of the book was a little too meek / brainwashed in my opinion.
          the book itself is very sad. the overall vibe is just a heavy sigh. that's my whole reaction. although not a terrible read, it's not my personal cup of tea.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>case study</h3>
        <p>a longer read, characters were very quaint! it was a little hard to get into in the beginning but still an interesting read overall. it wasn't a "can't put the book down kind of read" but i didn't mind reading it nonetheless.
          it was interesting to see the development of the main character throughout the book!
